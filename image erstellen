shrinking .img file

Let's enable enable the loopback:
sudo modprobe loop

Let's request a new (free) loopback device:
sudo losetup -f

The command returns the path to a free loopback device:
/dev/loop0

Let's create a device of the image:
sudo losetup /dev/loop0 myimage.img

The device /dev/loop0 represents myimage.img. We want to access the partitions that are on the image, so we need to ask the kernel to load those too:
sudo partprobe /dev/loop0
$lsblk | grep loop
This should give us the device /dev/loop0p1 and /dev/loopp2, which represents partition in myimage.img. We do not need this device directly, but parted requires it.

root@cloud:/home/ISOs# parted /dev/loop0

Warning: Shrinking a partition can cause data loss, are you sure you want to
continue?
Yes/No? Yes

Now we don't need the loopback-device anymore, so unload it:

root@cloud:/home/ISOs# losetup -d /dev/loop0

Shaving the image:

Now that we have all the important data at the beginning of the image it is time to shave off that unallocated part. We will first need to know where our partition ends and where the unallocated part begins. We do this using fdisk:

fdisk -l myimage.img
Here we will see an output similar to the following:

Disk dietPi-hole.img: 59.48 GiB, 63864569856 bytes, 124735488 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0xcb891ace

Device           Boot  Start      End  Sectors  Size Id Type
dietPi-hole.img1 *      8192   270335   262144  128M  c W95 FAT32 (LBA)
dietPi-hole.img2      270336 15625000 15354665  7.3G 83 Linux

Note two things in the output:

The partition ends on block 15625000 (shown under End)
The block-size is 512 bytes (shown as sectors of 1 * 512)
We will use these numbers in the rest of the example. The block-size (512) is often the same, but the ending block (15625000) will differ for you.

Next we shrink the image-file to a size that can just contain the partition. For this we will use the truncate command (thanks uggla!). With the truncate command need to supply the size of the file in bytes. The last block was 9181183 and block-numbers start at 0. That means we need (9181183+1)*512 bytes. This is important, else the partition will not fit the image. So now we use truncate with the calculations:

$truncate --size=$[(15625000+1)*512] dietPi-hole.img
